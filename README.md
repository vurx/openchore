## Why OpenChore

Chore charts fall apart because nobody looks at them. OpenChore is built for a
tablet mounted where the family already stands — the kitchen wall — so the chart
looks back.

- **Every kid gets their own app.** Each person picks a skin — warm
  **Sunroom**, bold **Blocks** or dark **Tint** — and a colour that follows
  them everywhere. Shared screens stay neutral so nobody's look wins.
- **It runs on your hardware.** A single static binary and a SQLite file. No
  subscription, no account, no telemetry.
- **Points are a real economy.** Every credit and debit lands in a transaction
  ledger. Kids spend on rewards you define, at prices you set.
- **The rules do the nagging.** Deadlines, time locks, expiry penalties, and
  daily decay are enforced by the server, not by you at 9pm.
- **Built to be wired up.** Signed outbound webhooks, per-chore trigger URLs,
  API tokens, and a Home Assistant integration.
- **Optional AI, your choice of model.** A vision model can pre-check photo
  proof for you and write up each week, and chores can be read aloud in a
  recorded voice. Point it at a model on your own machine or a hosted one — or
  leave it off entirely.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/liftedkilt/openchore.git
cd openchore
cp config/config.example.yaml config/config.yaml   # your family, chores, rewards
docker compose up -d
```

Open **http://localhost:8080** and tap your door on the family picker.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Parents sign in to their own profile with a PIN (the example config uses
> `1234` for Alex and `5678` for Jamie) and then tap **Manage**. Change those
> PINs before putting this on your network: tap your avatar, then
> **Change PIN**.
> Want Pocket ID, Authelia, Google or another OpenID Connect sign-in? See
> [Signing in](docs/authentication.md).

`config.yaml` is applied **only when the database is empty**. After first boot,
manage everything from the admin panel — or wipe and re-seed with
`./redeploy.sh --wipe`. Starting with no config at all drops you into a guided
setup wizard instead.

Want the AI extras? They are off by default. Point OpenChore at any
OpenAI-compatible model — a local one from the compose profiles below, Ollama,
or a hosted API — see [AI features](docs/ai.md):

```bash
# in .env: AI_BASE_URL=http://llama:8080/v1  AI_MODEL=gemma-4-e4b
#          TTS_BASE_URL=http://kokoro:8880/v1
docker compose --profile ai --profile tts up -d   # Gemma 4 E4B (~6 GB RAM) + Kokoro voices (~2 GB)
```

### Upgrading to 1.0

1.0 is the first versioned release: a redesigned app, per-person skins and
colours, sign-in on each profile, and an AI that only advises. Pull the new
images and restart; migrations run on start. Existing themes are mapped to the
new skins and everyone is given a colour. Two things need a look:

- **Sign-in.** The household passcode is gone; every parent now needs their
  own PIN or linked account. See
  [Upgrading from the household passcode](docs/authentication.md#upgrading-from-the-household-passcode).
- **AI.** The LiteRT/Ollama settings are replaced by any OpenAI-compatible
  endpoint. See
  [Upgrading from the LiteRT/Ollama setup](docs/ai.md#upgrading-from-the-litertollama-setup).

## How the points work

The scheduling model is what makes the economy hold together. Chores fall into
three tiers, and the tiers gate each other:

| Tier               | Behavior                                                                                    |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Required** | Non-negotiable. Nothing else pays out until these are done.                                 |
| **Core**     | The daily routine. Points are held**pending** until every required chore is complete. |
| **Bonus**    | Optional extras. Only awarded once required*and* core are finished.                       |

That single rule stops the obvious exploit: cherry-picking the fun 15-point
bonus chore and skipping the ones that matter.

Around it sit the other levers:

- **Time locks** — a chore stays hidden until `available_at`, and groups itself
  into morning / afternoon / evening.
- **Deadlines** — past `due_by`, a schedule either **blocks** completion, awards
  **no points**, or applies a **penalty**, your choice per schedule.
- **Decay** — an optional daily debit when the previous day was left unfinished.
  Points already committed to a savings goal are not a safe harbour: if the
  spendable balance can't cover the debit, decay reclaims the rest from the
  kid's goals (personal first, then their share of a family pool).
- **Streaks** — consecutive days with everything non-bonus done, with milestone
  bonuses you configure.
- **Approval** — chores can require a parent to sign off, with photo proof, before
  points are released.

## A look around

### One app, three skins

Each kid's screen is the same app — same tabs, same chore rows, same one-tap
check — drawn in the skin they chose. Their progress hero changes with it: a
sun arc, a ring, or a row of shapes.

<table>
<tr>
<td width="33%"><img src="docs/screenshots/kid-dashboard.png" alt="Emma's Today screen in the Sunroom skin: a sun arc showing 4 of 10 done, then Must do chores with three ticked off"></td>
<td width="33%"><img src="docs/screenshots/kid-today-tint.png" alt="Lily's Today screen in the dark Tint skin, lit in her mint colour, with a 2 of 9 progress ring"></td>

<td align="center"><b>Sunroom</b> — warm and soft</td>

<tr>
<td align="center"><b>Week</b> — each day's ring and the streak</td>
<td align="center"><b>Rewards</b> — spend it now or save for it</td>
<td align="center"><b>Sign in</b> — PIN or single sign-on</td>
</tr>
</table>

### The family's screens

Anything that shows more than one person uses **House**, a neutral frame (with
**House Dark** for the evening) where each person appears as a door in their own
skin.

## Development & Local Run / 本地运行

### 1. 本地原生开发启动 (Native Dev)

无需 Docker，直接在 Mac / Linux 本地运行开发环境（需要 Go 1.25+ 与 Node 22+）：

```bash
# 1. 安装前后端依赖（重要：确保 Vite 等前端依赖安装完毕）
make install

# 2. 准备配置文件（若未自动生成）
cp config/config.example.yaml config/config.yaml

# 3. 启动开发模式（同时并发启动 API :8080 与 Vite :5173）
make dev
```

> **提示**：
>
> - `make dev` 每次启动时会刷新本地 SQLite 数据库并基于 `config/config.yaml` 重新注入初始数据。
> - `config/config.yaml` 中每项家务的 `schedules[].assign_to` 所指派的用户名必须在顶层的 `users` 列表中存在。
> - 也可单独启动某一端：`make api`（仅后端）或 `make ui`（仅前端）。

### 2. 本地 Docker 运行 (Docker Run)

在本地通过容器运行（自适应 Mac Apple Silicon ARM64 及 Linux x86_64）：

```bash
# 拷贝配置文件
cp config/config.example.yaml config/config.yaml

# 本地构建并后台启动
make docker-up
# 等同于: docker compose up -d --build

# 停止容器
make docker-down
# 等同于: docker compose down
```

启动后访问 **http://localhost:8080** 即可。

## Docker 镜像构建 (Building Images)

### 本地架构镜像构建 (Mac ARM64 / Linux AMD64)

构建针对当前主机架构的原生镜像：

```bash
# 一键构建所有服务镜像
make docker-build

# 或单独构建后端 API 镜像
docker build -t openchore-api:latest -f Dockerfile .

# 或单独构建前端 Web 镜像
docker build -t openchore-web:latest -f web/Dockerfile ./web
```

### 多架构镜像构建 (Multi-Arch: Linux AMD64 + Mac ARM64)

本项目 Dockerfile 采用了 `--platform=$BUILDPLATFORM` 与 Go 跨架构编译支持，可通过 Docker Buildx 一次性构建支持多种架构的镜像：

```bash
# 使用 Makefile 快捷构建
make docker-build-multiarch

# 或直接使用 docker buildx
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 -t openchore-api:latest -f Dockerfile .
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 -t openchore-web:latest -f web/Dockerfile ./web
```

---

The stack is Go with `chi` and pure-Go SQLite (`CGO_ENABLED=0`, WAL, single
writer), React 18 + TypeScript + Vite on the front, and `golang-migrate` with
embedded SQL for schema changes. Tests are integration-first: a real database
and `httptest`, no mocks.
